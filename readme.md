# Moving from jQuery to Polymer.js

This code sample demonstrates how to take an existing interaction built with using a traditional
jQuery approach and show how to refactor it to use the native selection API, then implemented as
a native Web Component and finally as a Polymer.js component.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/craigshoemaker/jquery-to-polymer

Then, change into the folder:

    cd jquery-to-polymer

Next, install the dependencies:

    npm install

Finally, run the application:

    npm start

## Seed Branch
Note that the `seed` branch features the same code as in  the `master` branch except the body of the JavaScript modules is removed. If you want to follow the course along from scratch, you can start with the `seed` branch.
